TODO:
* Look for more command parsers that could benefit from getopts.
* Probably could clean up the root command check... but should I?
* Restructure the CONF_* property lists to allow separation between
  .defaults-only properties and also unique jail-only properties.
* Homogenize user message formatting. This should make writing helpers
  for messaging easier.
* Use jail's ftp settings for updates.
