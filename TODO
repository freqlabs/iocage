TODO:
* Look for more command parsers that could benefit from getopts.
* Probably could clean up the root command check... but should I?
* Add options for the clone sub-command to make it possible to keep
  properties from the source.
* Restructure the CONF_* property lists to allow separation between
  .defaults-only properties and also unique jail-only properties.
* Terminal color detection in lib/ioc-global to properly set OK and FAILED.
