TODO:
* Look for more command parsers that could benefit from getopts.
* Probably could clean up the root command check... but should I?
* Add options for the clone sub-command to make it possible to keep
  properties from the source.
* Restructure the CONF_* property lists to allow separation between
  .defaults-only properties and also unique jail-only properties.
* Figure out what the heck altroot support is for, if it's actually
  practical, and how to achieve it without self-patching ioc-globals
  if deemed legitimately useful.
* Consolidate distributed ${iocroot} in fs lists to be simply part of
  the loop.
* Homogenize user message formatting. This should make writing helpers
  for messaging easier.
